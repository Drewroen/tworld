  Welcome to Tile World

Tile World is an emulation of the game "Chip's Challenge" for the Atari
Lynx, created by Chuck Sommerville, and later ported to MS Windows by
Microsoft (among other ports).

IMPORTANT NOTE: Tile World is an emulation of the game engines only. It
does not come with the chips.dat file that contains the original level set.
This file is copyrighted and cannot be freely distributed. The chips.dat
file was originally distributed with the MS version of "Chip's Challenge".
If you have a copy of this version of the game, you can use that file to
play the game in Tile World. If you do not have a copy of this file,
however, you can still play Tile World with the many freely available level
files created by fans of the original game.

This is a pre-release version of Tile World, meaning that I currently
believe the program to be complete. Documentation and some final testing
are the main tasks that need to be completed before making a 1.0 release.

For directions on getting the program set up and running, see the INSTALL
file.

  Some Notes on the External Resource Files

Tile World loads most of its resource data at runtime from external files.
(The one exception is the program icon, which is hard-coded.) These files
are stored in the res directory. You can specify a different directory at
runtime using the -R command-line option.

The rc file in this directory lists the actual file names for each
resource. Different files can be used for any or all resources depending on
whether the Lynx or the MS ruleset is in effect. The first section of the
rc file specifies resources used with either. Then follows two sections,
prefixed with a line containing either [MS] or [Lynx], containing files
specific to the given ruleset.

The TileImages resource names the bitmap file containing the complete set
of tiles. The tiles in this bitmap are organized in the same fashion as the
bitmap resource embedded in the Windows executable chips.exe. If you have
this program and a resource editor, you can obtain this bitmap and use it
as the TileImages resource to make the game appear more like the MS
version. (Note that this bitmap contains three unused tiles. These
positions are used by Tile World to provide tiles that only appear in the
Lynx ruleset. So, if you wish to use this bitmap for playing under both
rulesets, it is strongly advised that you supply non-blank images for
these.)

Most of the resources are sound files. The Tile World resource names for
the sounds in the MS ruleset have been chosen to match the keys that are
used in the entpack.ini file. This permits you to take the sound files that
are included with the MS version of the game, copy them to Tile World's
resource directory, and then cut-and-paste the lines identifying the sound
files from MS's entpack.ini to Tile World's rc file, if you so choose.
