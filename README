  Welcome to Tile World

Tile World is an emulation of the game "Chip's Challenge" for the Atari
Lynx, created by Chuck Sommerville, and later ported to MS Windows by
Microsoft (among other ports).

  Important Note

Tile World is an emulation of the "Chip's Challenge" game engines only. It
does not come with the chips.dat file that contains the original level set.
That file, which is copyrighted and cannot be freely distributed, was
originally distributed with the MS version of "Chip's Challenge". If you
have a copy of this version of the game, you can use that file to play the
original games in Tile World. If you do not have a copy of this file,
however, you can still play Tile World with the many freely available level
files created by fans of the original game.

  Installing Tile World under Windows

There's no automatic installer (yet), so you will need to do this manually.

First of all, you'll want to store the files contained in this archive into
its own separate directory. So, if you haven't already done so, create a
new directory -- something like c:\tworld -- and extract the files there.

If you have a copy of the chips.dat data file, copy it to the data
subdirectory. This will allow you to play the original levels under Tile
World (for the MS ruleset and the Lynx ruleset both).

If you have other data files that you would like to try out in Tile World,
copy those to the sets directory.

The MSDOS commands to do the above would look something like:

  cd c:\wherever\my\copy\of\chips\challenge\is\at
  copy chips.dat c:\tworld\data
  cd c:\my\collection\of\dat\files
  copy *.dat c:\tworld\sets

That's all that needs to be done to set it up. Run the program as
c:\tworld\tworld, or create a shortcut for it.

  Installing Tile World under Linux

Before proceeding, ensure that you have SDL installed on your machine. (If
you don't have SDL, you can get it by visiting
http://www.libsdl.org/download.html. If you download a precompiled version
-- i.e., an .rpm or .deb file -- note that you will need the development
runtime, as opposed to the binary runtime.)

Installing Tile World involves the usual three-part incantation:

  ./configure

By default, the program is set up so that it will keep its shared files
under /usr/local/share/tworld. If you would prefer the tworld directory to
be somewhere besides /usr/local/share, use the --datadir option to change
it when you run ./configure. Alternately, you can use the
--with-sharedir=DIR option to explicitly specify a completely different
path. (This value can also be changed at runtime, either via the TWORLDDIR
environment variable or via the command line.)

  make

There shouldn't be any serious warnings from the compiler. Use "make
mklynxcc" if you want to also build a copy of mklynxcc (see below).

  make install

Running "make install" as root will do the following:

* Copy the tworld binary to /usr/local/games.
* Copy the tworld.6 manpage to /usr/local/man/man6.
* Create /usr/local/share/tworld if it does not exist. (Or whatever
  directory you specified to ./configure.)
* Copy the external resources (i.e., the bitmaps and wave files) to
  /usr/local/share/tworld/res.
* Create the directories /usr/local/share/tworld/data and
  /usr/local/share/tworld/sets.

The sets directory is where you will store the .dat files that you want to
use. However, if you want to make use of a configuration file with a
particular data file, then you will need to store the data file in the data
directory, and the configuration file goes into the sets directory instead.
See the documentation for more information.

  The Complete Documentation

The full documentation for Tile World is included with the distribution, in
the file tworld.html. There you will find information on how to play the
game, adding new level sets, customizing Tile World, and more.

  Creating new level sets for the Lynx ruleset

At the time of this writing, there do not exist any user-created level sets
for the Lynx ruleset. The reason for this is very simple; there has not
been any way to play such levels before. Hopefully, now that Tile World
exists, that will change in the near future.

If you yourself would like to create new level sets, then get a copy of
ChipEdit, if you haven't already. ChipEdit can be obtained from
http://www.stage62.com/chipedit/chipedit.htm. This Windows program will
permit you to create new level sets of your own design. Naturally, ChipEdit
will default to creating levels for the MS ruleset. To make levels for the
Lynx ruleset, you have a few options:

* ChipEdit has a special feature which allows you to control the signature
  of the data file. This is done by adding a SIGNATURE entry to the
  chipedit.ini file. The default signature value is 0x0002AAAC, which
  indicates a data file that uses the MS ruleset. If you set the SIGNATURE
  to be 0x0102AAAC, then ChipEdit will create data files marked to use the
  Lynx ruleset instead.
* A very simple command-line utility is included with Tile World, called
  mklynxcc. This program will change a normal .dat file to one that will
  use the Lynx ruleset instead of the MS ruleset. Running mklynxcc foo.dat
  will change foo.dat's ruleset from MS to Lynx.
* Finally, you can use a configuration file to override the builtin
  ruleset. This method requires creating an extra file, but does allows you
  to avoid making changes to the .dat file. See the complete documentation
  for information on how to set up a configuration file.

  Resources on the Internet

There is quite a bit of information about "Chip's Challenge" available on
the internet. Much of it is focused on maximizing your score on the
"original" level set for the MS game, but you will also find lots of
general help and useful information as well.

Richard Field and Jimmy Vermeer both maintain a page of links to nearly
everything on the net related to "Chip's Challenge". Between the two of
them you can probably find what you're looking for, if it's out there:

Most if not all user-created level sets can be found at the chips_challenge
Yahoo group:

"Chip's Challenge" was designed by Chuck Sommerville, who is also the

Creating this program would have been flatly impossible without the help of
several fans of "Chip's Challenge". The author would particularly like to
acknowledge Anders Kaseorg for sharing the fruits of his investigations
into the game logic of the MS version and for being an effective bug
hunter, and Chuck Sommerville for his pointers regarding the game logic of
the Lynx version and his unfailing support of this project.

Many other regulars of the annexcafe.chips.challenge newsgroup assisted
with bug reports, suggestions, and all-around encouragement. Their help is
gratefully acknowledged.

The anonymous author of the document describing the .dat file format, Don
Gregory, the "Charter Chipsters", and the contributors to the CC AVI
library all deserve mention as well -- this program would never have been
written without the information they made freely available.

Last but not least, a tip of the hat to John K. Elion for writing ChipEdit.
